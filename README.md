# FlexNet
A neural network with flexible parameters - number of layers, number of neurons, regularization lambda value etc. 

## Data
Flexnet uses data from several sources to induce different models.
#### Habermanâ€™s Survival Data Set

#### Wine Data Set

## Evaluation
Flexnet measures accuracy and other quality indicators with cross validation, selecting the best models among the a pool of differently parameterized networks.

## Why?
This is a project for UFRGS's (Univerdade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul) subject Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, of the Computer Engineering degree.
